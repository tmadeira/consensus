This repository contains code, data and plots used in an accepted paper that
will be published in the 35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI
2021).

_Link for the final version of the paper coming soon._

### Usage

To compile:

```
$ make
```

You must have [Go](https://golang.org/). The code was tested with go version
go1.15.1 linux/amd64.

To run:

```
$ ./simulator <tp> <n> <times> <memory> [<threads>] [<seed>]
```

where `<tp>` is the network structure, `<n>` is the number of nodes, `<times>`
is the number of times to run the experiment, `<memory>` is the probability of
looking to current state (i.e., use `1.0` to make an experiment with no
memory), `<threads>` is the number of threads the simulator should use,
`<seed>` is the random seed.

**Supported network structures:**
biclique, bintree, clique, cycle, path, torus.

See exp1.py for an example of how to use the simulator to produce some useful
data. See exp1-plot.py for an example of how to plot data computed by exp1.py.

See plots/ for generated plots.
